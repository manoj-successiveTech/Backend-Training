It is a popular tool for testing and interacting with APIs
Allows us to send HTTP requests like GET, POST, DELETE, PUT and see responses in easy to use interface
We can use is to :
Send test requests to endpoints
View and debug responses
check request/response headers
Test error handling and edge cases
How to use :
