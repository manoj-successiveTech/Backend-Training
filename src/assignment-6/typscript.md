# TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. Developed and maintained by Microsoft, it compiles down to plain JavaScript, allowing it to run in any environment where JavaScript is supported, including browsers, Node.js, and other platforms.

TypeScript is a **strongly typed** programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding **static type definitions**. It helps developers catch errors early through a robust type system and improves tooling with features like **autocompletion**, **navigation**, and **refactoring**.

TypeScript code is **transpiled** to JavaScript, which means it runs anywhere JavaScript runs — in the browser, Node.js, and more.

# Key characteristics of TypeScript include:

->Static Typing:- It introduces the ability to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This allows for early detection of type-related errors during development (compile-time) rather than at runtime.

Superset of JavaScript:- All valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This means developers can gradually adopt TypeScript in existing JavaScript projects.

Enhanced Tooling:- TypeScript provides improved tooling support in integrated development environments (IDEs) and text editors, offering features like intelligent code completion, refactoring, and error checking.

Object-Oriented Features:
It includes features like interfaces, enums, and access modifiers, which are common in object-oriented programming languages and can aid in building more structured and maintainable applications.

Compilation to JavaScript:
Before execution, TypeScript code is "transpiled" into standard JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across various JavaScript environments.

## Why Use TypeScript?

- **Type Safety**: Detects errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
- **Better IDE Support**: TypeScript offers advanced code completion, navigation, and refactoring.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Code is easier to understand with types.
- **Large-Scale Applications**: Encourages scalable architecture and helps in managing large codebases.

## Getting Started

To install TypeScript globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

To compile a TypeScript file:

```bash
tsc filename.ts
```

## Basic Types in TypeScript

TypeScript offers a wide variety of basic types:

### 1. `number`
All numbers in TypeScript are floating-point values.

```ts
let count: number = 42;
```

### 2. `string`
Textual data.

```ts
let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
```

### 3. `boolean`
Represents a true/false value.

```ts
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
```

### 4. `null` and `undefined`

```ts
let u: undefined = undefined;
let n: null = null;
```

### 5. `any`
A type that disables type checking.

```ts
let notSure: any = "Could be anything";
notSure = 5; // still valid
```

### 6. `unknown`
A safer alternative to `any`. You must perform type checking before performing operations.

```ts
let value: unknown = "Hello";
if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase());
}
```

### 7. `void`
Used for functions that don’t return a value.

```ts
function logMessage(): void {
  console.log("Logging message...");
}
```

### 8. `never`
Represents values that never occur (e.g., a function that always throws an error).

```ts
function throwError(): never {
  throw new Error("This will never return");
}
```

### 9. `array`
Two syntaxes:

```ts
let list1: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let list2: Array<string> = ["a", "b", "c"];
```

### 10. `tuple`
An array with fixed types and length.

```ts
let user: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
```

### 11. `enum`
Enumerated type.

```ts
enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue,
}

let c: Color = Color.Green;
```

### 12. `object`

```ts
let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 25,
};
```

## Variables in TypeScript

### Declaring Variables

TypeScript uses the same variable declaration keywords as JavaScript: `let`, `const`, and `var`. But with types.

```ts
let firstName: string = "John";
const age: number = 25;
var isAdmin: boolean = false;
```

### Type Inference

TypeScript automatically infers the type if it can be determined from the initializer.

```ts
let greeting = "Hello"; // inferred as string
```

### Explicit Typing

You can explicitly specify a variable's type using a colon `:` followed by the type.

```ts
let score: number;
score = 99;
```

---

## Type Assertions

You can override TypeScript’s inferred type using **type assertions**:

```ts
let someValue: unknown = "This is a string";

let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
// or
let strLengthAlt: number = (<string>someValue).length;
```

---

## Summary

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with strong typing.
- It provides static type checking which helps in reducing bugs.
- Basic types include `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `any`, `unknown`, `void`, `never`, `array`, `tuple`, and `enum`.
- TypeScript supports both **type inference** and **explicit typing**.
- TypeScript encourages writing cleaner, more maintainable, and bug-resistant code.
